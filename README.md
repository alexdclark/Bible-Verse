# Bible-Verse
Simple C# Windows form application that returns a specific bible verse based upon user input. 

Type in the bible verse into the field and click search. This uses an online Bible API and the Windows Form Application will send a request string based off your input into the API which will return a webpage with text which the application then parses through.
